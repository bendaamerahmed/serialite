= SeriaLite User Guide

== Introduction

SeriaLite is a modular, high-performance serialization library for Java.
It supports multiple formats, plugin-based extensibility, and Spring Boot integration.

== Quick Start

1. Add the dependency to your project:
....
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.example.serialite</groupId>
  <artifactId>seriaLite-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
....

2. Use SeriaLite facade to serialize/deserialize:
....
TestObject obj = new TestObject("hello", 1);
byte[] data = SeriaLite.serialize(obj, "json");
TestObject clone = SeriaLite.deserialize(data, TestObject.class, "json");
....

== Plugin System

SeriaLite uses Java's ServiceLoader mechanism to discover new formats automatically.
Just include the plugin JAR in the classpath.

== Spring Boot Integration

To integrate with Spring Boot:
* Include `seriaLite-spring-boot` in your classpath.
* SeriaLiteAutoConfiguration will register a `SeriaLite` bean automatically.

== Performance & Benchmarks

We provide a JMH-based benchmarking module (`seriaLite-benchmarks`) to compare
SeriaLite with other libraries like Jackson, Kryo, etc.
